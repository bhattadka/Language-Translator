# Language-Translator

## Overview

The Language Translator project is a simple yet powerful translation application built using Python's Tkinter library and the `googletrans` API. The application provides an intuitive user interface for translating text from one language to another. This project aims to help users overcome language barriers by providing quick and accurate translations.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files and folders:

- **Images Folder**: This folder contains images used in the application.
  - `arrow.png`: Image of an arrow used in the interface.
  - `google.png`: Google Translate icon used in the application.

- `Test Output 1.png`: Screenshot showing the translation result for a specific input.

- `Test Output 2.png`: Screenshot showing another translation result for a different input.

- `Translator Interface.png`: Screenshot of the main interface of the translator application.

- `google_translator.py`: The main Python script that contains the code for the Language Translator application. This file includes the implementation of the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and the integration with the `googletrans` API for translation.
